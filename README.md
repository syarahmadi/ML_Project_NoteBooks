# ML_Project_NoteBooks

Welcome to ML_Project_NoteBooks! This repository is dedicated to showcasing machine learning projects, ranging from face emotion recognition to pneumonia detection and analyzing Prosper loan data. Each notebook is tailored to guide you through the project's methodology, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Projects Overview

- **FaceEmotionRecognition.ipynb**: Dive into the world of computer vision with this project, where we develop and train a model to recognize human emotions from facial expressions.

- **PneumoniaDetection_.ipynb**: This project applies deep learning techniques to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images, demonstrating the power of AI in healthcare.

- **Prosper_Loan_data.ipynb**: Explore a dataset of loans from Prosper to uncover insights and patterns, utilizing data visualization and machine learning techniques.
  
- **Movie_Recommender_System:** Develops a basic recommender system using collaborative filtering with the Python library `surprise`. The goal of this system is to recommend movies to users based on their past preferences and the preferences of other users with similar tastes.
